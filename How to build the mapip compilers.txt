1. Create a directory inside gcc3
2. Move into that directory.
3. type:

../configure --prefix=/usr/mapip --target=mapip --with-system-zlib

4. Build the compilers with:
make -k

5. Once finished the compilers will be in ggc3/<YourBuildDir>/gcc/

Notes
-----

To remake the compiler from scratch type:

make clean
make

When modifying the compiler, remember to delete, all mapip*.o objects,
then just use make agian, its worth noting that gcc can be built inside 
gcc3/<YourBuildDir>/gcc/ or in gcc3/<YourBuildDir>.

Reconfiguring
-------------

If you need to reconfigure the compiler you must always:

make distclean

before invoking the new configure.
